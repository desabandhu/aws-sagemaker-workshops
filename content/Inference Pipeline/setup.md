# Workshop Setup 

### Log Into the AWS Console

To complete this workshop you need an **AWS account with administrative permissions**. This is needed to create or modify resources and allow AWS RoboMaker to interact with services on your behalf.

**Note: We will use us-west-2 (Oregon) for this workshop.**

If you are in a classroom setting, we will provide a credit code which you should apply it now. To apply the credit code, select your username from the top right corner of the AWS console and click **My Account**. Next, click on **Credits**.
